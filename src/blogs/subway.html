          Subway is genuinely the best place to eat on campus. No, I haven't
          eaten everywhere, but for the price, it is the greatest bang for your
          buck. Sure, you COULD eat at Chick-fil-a, but you get MUCH less actual
          *food* there for the same price. A 12 inch sandwich from Subway is
          ONLY about 10 bucks, not to mention the cookies. The cookies are half
          of the appeal. Please be careful when ordering cookies on GrubHub, as
          they can be forgotten. CHECK YOUR BAGS. To sum up, if you haven't been
          to a subway on campus, try it out. Reliable good cheap food that's
          open late.
